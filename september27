### Good showing of about 20 people. Overview of experience showed that we can start from the beginning in terms of learning to code.
### Created a WhatsApp group to stay in touch and agreed to meet every other week. Next meeting on October 11th. Optional weekend coding meetups will be started as well. 
### Idea generating stage and overall strategic orientation of the club is still in process due to student government still not being in place, and funding situation still undetermined. 
### Members were encouraged to open accounts on DataCamp, FreeCodeCamp and Tableau to take advantage of their free courseware opportunities and to start their engagement with coding.
### Long-term goals were asked about and we were immediately able to identify one goal that we could start on immediately which has the aim of helping the student body as a whole and which hopefully can be carried on to the following years. See "Parkes Project".
